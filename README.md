power-law-testing
=================

Testing power law statistics for large data using existing code would have taken weeks. So I added a little bit of multi-core capability. Enjoy!

The core code is from Aaron Clauset and can be reached at http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/.
The multi-processor class was written by Morgan Frank, a colleauge in the Computational Story Lab (http://onehappybird.com/).

If you use this code combination, I'd appreciate an aknowledgement!

Fork and improve!
